# Anglo-Orthodoxy 

Anglo-Orthodox is a collection of articles from [Thom Crowe](https://thomcrowe.com), a former Eastern Orthodox deacon who has found his home in the Anglican Tradition and hopefully some friends he meets along the way. We believe the light from the Christian East has much to offer to the West and fits in nicely with our Anglican Tradition.
